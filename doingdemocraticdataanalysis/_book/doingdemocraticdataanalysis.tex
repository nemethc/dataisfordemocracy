I believe that data, \emph{in the hands of public administrators and
policy analysts}\footnote{\emph{Not IT departments}}, has the power to
transform the way government works.

Big questions will, and should, be asked of big data--- the role of
government in regulating algorithmic bias, facial recognition, and
consumer data privacy is a vital conversation. However, these topics
should not detract or deter public administrators and policy analysts
from leaning into \textbf{small data} for decision-making purposes.

Public administrators and analysts who are data literate will be able to
make and inform better decisions while avoiding the pitfalls posed by
the latest technological trends. This book represents an opportunity for
public administrators and policy analysts to join their subject matter
expertise with foundation principles and practices of democratic data
analysis--- data analysis that is \textbf{transparent, relevant, and
grounded in the context of ethical and effective governance}.

\section*{Who is this guide for?}\label{who-is-this-guide-for}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Who is this guide for?}

This guide is for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the budget analyst at the Department of Fish and Wildlife who has to
  compile a monthly report analyzing revenues,
\item
  the manager at the Department of Social and Health Services who is
  tracking inventory, and
\item
  the research analyst working for the state Legislature who wants to
  incorporate data into her work session on the latest policy debate.
\end{itemize}

\section*{What will I learn?}\label{what-will-i-learn}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{What will I learn?}

You will learn an opinionated framework for data analysis in public
sector organizations. By opinionated, I mean that I will teach you what
I think is the right way to do things given my own experience as a
public sector policy and data analyst. Your experience might differ--
and that's great. I hope that where you can use your experience in place
of mine, you do to the fullest extent. With that in mind, it is often
said that you have to know the rules to break them, so I will teach you
the ``rules'' as I understand them.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

\section{What is democratic data
analysis?}\label{what-is-democratic-data-analysis}

This is little-d democracy here, people. Not a guide to data analysis
for Democrats, but an approach to data that empowers the subject matter
experts within public organizations to do their best work.

\section{Do I need to be an Excel god before I
begin?}\label{do-i-need-to-be-an-excel-god-before-i-begin}

\textbf{No.}

\section{What tools should I use?}\label{what-tools-should-i-use}

This guide is written to be technology-agnostic and is not a tutorial on
specific tools. The changing nature of technology and the lag of state
agencies to pick up tools means that the principles outlined in this
book supersede specific technologies.

However, you should start somewhere. This guide will include examples in
both Excel and \texttt{R}. Government runs on Excel, so all of the
examples and exercises will be Excel compatible. If you are comfortable
with Excel\footnote{aka you use \texttt{vlookup}, \texttt{index(match)},
  pivot tables, or \emph{Get \& Transform} on a somewhat regular basis}
and want to challenge yourself, boost your resume, and become a data
wizard\footnote{For example, I used R to create this entire website}, I
would highly recommend learning \texttt{R}. This guide will wshow
examples on how to analyze data democratically using both tools, but
focusing on the principles and practices that are vital regardless of
technology. I will link to specific resources that provide more detailed
walk through's as necessary.

\section{Quickstart Guide to Excel}\label{quickstart-guide-to-excel}

Get \& Transform and Data Model

\section{Quickstart Guide to R}\label{quickstart-guide-to-r}

I would \textbf{HIGHLY} recommend you take an afternoon to work through
Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of
``\href{https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/index.html}{\emph{R
for Excel Users}}''. You will thank me later.

\section{How to Think about Democratic Data
Analysis}\label{how-to-think-about-democratic-data-analysis}

What is data analysis? It may be easier to start with what data analysis
isn't.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Data analysis isn't math in Excel or a set of specific calculations.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Calculations are great, but \texttt{a7\ +\ b8} in Excel is
  deterministic. It gives you one answer. This book is not interested in
  data analysis that gives you the right answer, because there is no
  such thing. There are many answers to many questions, depending on how
  those questions are asked and how the data is analyzed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Data analysis isn't statistics.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Look, regressions are great, but that isn't the crux of this book.
  This book is about reading and telling the story of your data in a way
  that can complement expertise and experience to make better decisions.
  Statistics are often used as a cheap stand-in for domain expertise and
  are often abused in favor of trusting the analyst or administrator to
  back up their assumptions with both quantitative and qualitiative
  data.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Data analysis isn't research methods.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No set of tools and practices can stand in for asking the right
  questions, and transforming data into information to answer that
  question. This book will give you the tools to work with your
  quantitative data to answer relevant questions, but all good analysis
  begins with a good question.
\end{itemize}

So what are the principles of democratic data analysis?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Democratic data analysis gives power to the subject matter expert.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Working with your own data lets you answer your question, rather than
  outsource those questions to IT departments who don't have the context
  necessary to turn data into information.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Democratic data analysis is easily shared and reproduced.
\item
  Democratic data analysis is honest about its assumptions and
  limitations.
\item
  Democratic data analysis is structured to be easily understood and
  communicated.
\item
  Democratic data analysis is approached methodically.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Alternate Forms of Data
Analysis}\label{alternate-forms-of-data-analysis}

I want to contrast democratic data analysis with alternate forms of
analysis that I have seen in my time working in the public sector.

\subsection*{Oligarchic Data Analysis}\label{oligarchic-data-analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Oligarchic Data Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  small group of ``data people''
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Monarchic Data Analysis}\label{monarchic-data-analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Monarchic Data Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Spreadsheets created decades ago, patched as necessary, and owned by a
  single or small group of people. Very unnaproachable. Can't ask
  questions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Dictitorial Data Analysis}\label{dictitorial-data-analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Dictitorial Data Analysis}

*Not reproducible, all hard-coded, can't ask questions,

*Excel workbooks straight from the depths of hell. Formulas on formulas
on macros.

\section{Principles of Democratic Data
Analysis}\label{principles-of-democratic-data-analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Think in terms of fields, not values
\item
  Leave breadcrumbs for others (and your future self)
\item
  Create a data pipeline and DO NOT DESTROY UNDERLYING DATA-- build
\item
  Make assumptions, and document them!
\item
  Show AND tell your results
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Tidy Data}\label{tidy-data}

\section{Tidy Data, or Why you should clean your
room}\label{tidy-data-or-why-you-should-clean-your-room}

\section[Learning the Language of Tidy Data]{\texorpdfstring{Learning
the Language of Tidy Data\footnote{Adapted from Hadley Wickham's paper
  on \href{https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf}{Tidy Data}}}{Learning the Language of Tidy Data}}\label{learning-the-language-of-tidy-data}

If you have ever typed a formula in excel, congrats! You are a
programmer. Embrace it! If you haven't, you will soon, and then you will
be a programmer too. Excel is the world's largest and most underrated
programming language. Now, you just have to embrace thinking
programmaticlly-- tidy. It's like grammar. There are rules so these
sentances (hopefully) make sense to you, the reader. Similarily, by
following common conventions of tidy data analysis, others will be able
to ``read'' your analysis like you are reading this sentance. And also,
like grammar, you can break the rules-- but it helps to know them first.

Here are a couple definitions that will help as you move through this
text. Don't worry about memorizing them, as I will refer back to these
definitions frequently.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fields

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A field is a fancy name for a column. From here on out, every
    calculation, manipulation, formula, you name it, will be on a
    column. I want you to forget that you could ever modify a lone cell
    in Excel. No more formulas in cells. No more typing in values to a
    cell. Certainly no more writing over data in a cell. Democratic data
    analysis depends on formulas that work on entire fields. Everything
    you would need to do to a single cell in Excel can-- and should!--
    be done to an entire column. This will be immensly valuable, as you
    will hopefully see while working through this material.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Variables

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A variable is something in your data that can change. That's it!
    Variables become very important when looking at how to structure
    your data.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Observations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Observations make up the rows of your dataset. Each observation
    should correspond to a specific ``thing.'' This will make more sense
    later, I promise.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Values

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Values are the actual data in your table. Each value belongs to 1
    (one) observation and 1 (one) variable.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Table

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A table is the grouping of all observations of a similar type.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An example relevent to public administration might make this more clear.
Below is a table\footnote{Data was created for demonstration purposes}
that shows types of retirement visits for a month at a state's
Department of Retirement Services by the employee who took the visit and
the visit type.
