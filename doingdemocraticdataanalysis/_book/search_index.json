What will I learn?", " Doing Democratic Data Analysis Corban Nemeth 2020-04-09 Preface I believe that data, in the hands of public administrators and policy analysts1, has the power to transform the way government works. Big questions will, and should, be asked of big data— the role of government in regulating algorithmic bias, facial recognition, and consumer data privacy is a vital conversation. However, these topics should not detract or deter public administrators and policy analysts from leaning into small data for decision-making purposes. Public administrators and analysts who are data literate will be able to make and inform better decisions while avoiding the pitfalls posed by the latest technological trends. This book represents an opportunity for public administrators and policy analysts to join their subject matter expertise with foundation principles and practices of democratic data analysis— data analysis that is transparent, relevant, and grounded in the context of ethical and effective governance. Who is this guide for? This guide is for: the budget analyst at the Department of Fish and Wildlife who has to compile a monthly report analyzing revenues, the manager at the Department of Social and Health Services who is tracking inventory, and the research analyst working for the state Legislature who wants to incorporate data into her work session on the latest policy debate. What will I learn? You will learn an opinionated framework for data analysis in public sector organizations. By opinionated, I mean that I will teach you what I think is the right way to do things given my own experience as a public sector policy and data analyst. Your experience might differ– and that’s great. I hope that where you can use your experience in place of mine, you do to the fullest extent. With that in mind, it is often said that you have to know the rules to break them, so I will teach you the “rules” as I understand them. summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 Not IT departments↩ "],

This is little-d democracy here, people. Not a guide to data analysis for Democrats, but an approach to data that empowers the subject matter experts within public organizations to do their best work. 1.2 Do I need to be an Excel god before I begin? No. 1.3 What tools should I use? This guide is written to be technology-agnostic and is not a tutorial on specific tools. The changing nature of technology and the lag of state agencies to pick up tools means that the principles outlined in this book supersede specific technologies. However, you should start somewhere. This guide will include examples in both Excel and R. Government runs on Excel, so all of the examples and exercises will be Excel compatible. If you are comfortable with Excel2 and want to challenge yourself, boost your resume, and become a data wizard3, I would highly recommend learning R. This guide will wshow examples on how to analyze data democratically using both tools, but focusing on the principles and practices that are vital regardless of technology. I will link to specific resources that provide more detailed walk through’s as necessary. 1.4 How to use this book 1.5 Quickstart Guide to Excel Get &amp; Transform and Data Model 1.6 Quickstart Guide to R I would HIGHLY recommend you take an afternoon to work through Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of “R for Excel Users”. You will thank me later. 1.7 How to Think about Democratic Data Analysis What is data analysis? It may be easier to start with what data analysis isn’t. Data analysis isn’t math in Excel or a set of specific calculations. Calculations are great, but a7 + b8 in Excel is deterministic. It gives you one answer. This book is not interested in data analysis that gives you the right answer, because there is no such thing. There are many answers to many questions, depending on how those questions are asked and how the data is analyzed. Data analysis isn’t statistics. Look, regressions are great, but that isn’t the crux of this book. This book is about reading and telling the story of your data in a way that can complement expertise and experience to make better decisions. Statistics are often used as a cheap stand-in for domain expertise and are often abused in favor of trusting the analyst or administrator to back up their assumptions with both quantitative and qualitiative data. Data analysis isn’t research methods. No set of tools and practices can stand in for asking the right questions, and transforming data into information to answer that question. This book will give you the tools to work with your quantitative data to answer relevant questions, but all good analysis begins with a good question. So what are the principles of democratic data analysis? Democratic data analysis gives power to the subject matter expert. Working with your own data lets you answer your question, rather than outsource those questions to IT departments who don’t have the context necessary to turn data into information. Democratic data analysis is easily shared and reproduced. Democratic data analysis is honest about its assumptions and limitations. Democratic data analysis is structured to be easily understood and communicated. Democratic data analysis is approached methodically. 1.8 Alternate Forms of Data Analysis I want to contrast democratic data analysis with alternate forms of analysis that I have seen in my time working in the public sector. Oligarchic Data Analysis small group of “data people” Monarchic Data Analysis Spreadsheets created decades ago, patched as necessary, and owned by a single or small group of people. Very unnaproachable. Can’t ask questions. Dictitorial Data Analysis *Not reproducible, all hard-coded, can’t ask questions, Technocratic Data Analysis *Excel workbooks straight from the depths of hell. Formulas on formulas on macros. 1.9 Principles of Democratic Data Analysis Think in terms of fields, not values Leave breadcrumbs for others (and your future self) Create a data pipeline and DO NOT DESTROY UNDERLYING DATA– build Make assumptions, and document them! Show AND tell your results aka you use vlookup, index(match), pivot tables, or Get &amp; Transform on a somewhat regular basis↩ For example, I used R to create this entire website↩ "],

You are a programmer. Embrace it! If you haven’t, you will soon, and then you will be a programmer too. Excel is the world’s largest and most underrated programming language. Now, you just have to embrace thinking programmaticlly– tidy. It’s like grammar. There are rules so these sentances (hopefully) make sense to you, the reader. Similarily, by following common conventions of tidy data analysis, others will be able to “read” your analysis like you are reading this sentance. And also, like grammar, you can break the rules– but it helps to know them first. Here are a couple definitions that will help as you move through this text. Don’t worry about memorizing them, as I will refer back to these definitions frequently. Fields A field is a fancy name for a column. From here on out, every calculation, manipulation, formula, you name it, will be on a column. I want you to forget that you could ever modify a lone cell in Excel. No more formulas in cells. No more typing in values to a cell. Certainly no more writing over data in a cell. Democratic data analysis depends on formulas that work on entire fields. Everything you would need to do to a single cell in Excel can– and should!– be done to an entire column. This will be immensly valuable, as you will hopefully see while working through this material. Variables A variable is something in your data that can change. That’s it! Variables become very important when looking at how to structure your data. Observations Observations make up the rows of your dataset. Each observation should correspond to a specific “thing.” This will make more sense later, I promise. Values Values are the actual data in your table. Each value belongs to 1 (one) observation and 1 (one) variable. Table A table is the grouping of all observations of a similar type. An example relevent to public administration might make this more clear. Below is a table5 that shows types of retirement visits for a month at a state’s Department of Retirement Services by the employee who took the visit and the visit type. library(tidyverse) visits &lt;- tribble( ~&quot;Employee&quot;, ~&quot;Phone Visits&quot;, ~&quot;Office Visits&quot;, ~&quot;Online Visits&quot;, &quot;Danielle&quot;, 6, 11, 23, &quot;Ramona&quot;, 11, 5, 18, &quot;Ross&quot;, 10, 10, 10 ) knitr::kable(visits, caption = &quot;Visits to the Dept. of Retirement Services in a given month&quot;) Table 2.1: Visits to the Dept. of Retirement Services in a given month Employee Phone Visits Office Visits Online Visits Danielle 6 11 23 Ramona 11 5 18 Ross 10 10 10 Data are frequently displayed in this “wide” format. It works great for presentation, but not great for data analysis. The shortcomings of data in this format may become apparent when you attempt to work with the data in a pivot table. This is becuase our columns aren’t truly variables. You can drag the fields from the top row to the grey box below, for columns, and the left, for rows. This becomes unmanegable quickly. rpivotTable::rpivotTable(visits, width = &quot;60%&quot;, height = &quot;60%&quot;) Let’s apply our criteria of tidy data to this set: Variables At first glance, it doensn’t look like this is a problem. But think again. Is phone visits really a variable? Or is the real variable of interest number of visits? And are our column names actually variables too (type of visit)? Let’s take another swing at setting up our table for data analysis purposes. This can be accomplished easily in R using the code below, or in Excel by loading the data with Get and Transform -&gt; selecting the three “visits” columns -&gt; right clicking -&gt; and selecting “unpivot columns.” #We have already loaded the &quot;tidyverse&quot; library so we do not have to do it again pivot_visits &lt;- visits %&gt;% #we are editing the &quot;visits&quot; table already created by storing it in a new table pivot_visits pivot_longer(-Employee, names_to = &quot;Visit Type&quot;, values_to = &quot;Number of Visits&quot;) #using pivot_longer on every column except &quot;employee&quot; and setting the name of the new columns knitr::kable(pivot_visits, caption = &quot;Visits to the Dept. of Retirement Services in a given month&quot;) Table 2.2: Visits to the Dept. of Retirement Services in a given month Employee Visit Type Number of Visits Danielle Phone Visits 6 Danielle Office Visits 11 Danielle Online Visits 23 Ramona Phone Visits 11 Ramona Office Visits 5 Ramona Online Visits 18 Ross Phone Visits 10 Ross Office Visits 10 Ross Online Visits 10 Now this is a table that is much easier to analyze in an Excel pivot table or with a variety of R functions. Using data in this format, it is easy to recreate the original table for presentation, while also giving a variety of options for formatting and plotting. Use the pivot table below to recreate the original table using the tidy data. *Hint- Instead of Count, select Sum -&gt; Number of Visits as the value field. It is far easier to work with fields when they are in a tidy format. rpivotTable::rpivotTable(pivot_visits, width = &quot;60%&quot;, height = &quot;400px&quot;) When we get to the next chapter, you will learn several alternatives to pivot tables that use the same principles, but are more reproducible. 2.3 Using lower level data Let’s introduce a slightly more complicated tidy data problem, using the same base data as before. visits_retirements &lt;- tribble( ~&quot;Employee&quot;, ~&quot;Phone Visits&quot;, ~&quot;Phone Retirements&quot;, ~&quot;Office Visits&quot;, ~&quot;Office Retirements&quot;, ~&quot;Online Visits&quot;, ~&quot;Online Retirements&quot;, &quot;Danielle&quot;, 6, 4, 11, 8, 23, 15, &quot;Ramona&quot;, 11, 7, 5, 3, 18, 15, &quot;Ross&quot;, 10, 8, 10, 7, 10, 9 ) knitr::kable(visits_retirements, caption = &quot;Visits to the Dept. of Retirement Services in a given month by employee and associated client retirements&quot;) Table 2.3: Visits to the Dept. of Retirement Services in a given month by employee and associated client retirements Employee Phone Visits Phone Retirements Office Visits Office Retirements Online Visits Online Retirements Danielle 6 4 11 8 23 15 Ramona 11 7 5 3 18 15 Ross 10 8 10 7 10 9 Hopefully you will see a similar pattern here. Now, there are three variables: Visit type, number of visits, and number of retirements. Again, this data works fine for presentation but could use tidying to ease in analysis. visits_retirements %&gt;% DT::datatable( extensions = &#39;Buttons&#39;, options = list(dom = &#39;Bfrtip&#39;, buttons = &#39;excel&#39;, searching = FALSE)) Try to tidy this in R or Excel Get and Transform. See this footnote6 or look at the code if you need a hint. visits_retirements_tidy &lt;- visits_retirements %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -Employee, names_to = c(&quot;Visit Location&quot;, &quot;Type&quot;), names_sep = &quot; &quot;) print(visits_retirements_tidy) ## # A tibble: 18 x 4 ## Employee `Visit Location` Type value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Danielle Phone Visits 6 ## 2 Danielle Phone Retirements 4 ## 3 Danielle Office Visits 11 ## 4 Danielle Office Retirements 8 ## 5 Danielle Online Visits 23 ## 6 Danielle Online Retirements 15 ## 7 Ramona Phone Visits 11 ## 8 Ramona Phone Retirements 7 ## 9 Ramona Office Visits 5 ## 10 Ramona Office Retirements 3 ## 11 Ramona Online Visits 18 ## 12 Ramona Online Retirements 15 ## 13 Ross Phone Visits 10 ## 14 Ross Phone Retirements 8 ## 15 Ross Office Visits 10 ## 16 Ross Office Retirements 7 ## 17 Ross Online Visits 10 ## 18 Ross Online Retirements 9 In this case, we actually pivoted too far. It will probably be more useful to have the counts of visits and retirements in their own category. Keep in mind the scope of the observation– It is perfectly valid for each to have their own column, as it is visits and retirements per month. visits_retirements_tidy2 &lt;- visits_retirements_tidy %&gt;% pivot_wider(id_cols = c(Employee, `Visit Location`, Type), names_from = Type, values_from = value) From here, it is easy to do calculations based on fields, rather than cells. 2.4 So how is this democratic? 2.5 Practice problems Adapted from Hadley Wickham’s paper on Tidy Data↩ Data was created for demonstration purposes↩ powerquery hints↩ "],
