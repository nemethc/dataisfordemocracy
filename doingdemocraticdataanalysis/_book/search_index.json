What will I learn?", " Doing Democratic Data Analysis Corban Nemeth 2020-04-02 Preface I believe that data, in the hands of public administrators and policy analysts1, has the power to transform the way government works. Big questions will, and should, be asked of big data— the role of government in regulating algorithmic bias, facial recognition, and consumer data privacy is a vital conversation. However, these topics should not detract or deter public administrators and policy analysts from leaning into small data for decision-making purposes. Public administrators and analysts who are data literate will be able to make and inform better decisions while avoiding the pitfalls posed by the latest technological trends. This book represents an opportunity for public administrators and policy analysts to join their subject matter expertise with foundational principles and practices of democratic data analysis— data analysis that is transparent, relevant, and grounded in the context of ethical and effective governance. Who is this guide for? This guide is for: the budget analyst at the Department of Fish and Wildlife who has to compile a monthly report analyzing revenues, the manager at the Department of Social and Health Services who is tracking inventory, and the research analyst working for the state Legislature who wants to incorporate data into her work session on the latest policy debate. What will I learn? You will learn an opinionated apprach to data analysis in public sector organizations. By opionionated, I mean that I will teach you what I think is the right way to do things given my own experience as a public sector policy and data analyst. Your experience might differ– and that’s great. I hope that where you can use your experience in place of mine, you do to the fullest extent. With that in mind, it is often said that you have to know the rules to break them, so I will teach you the “rules”&quot; as I understand them. Not IT departments↩ "],

This is little-d democracy here, people. Not a guide to data analysis for Democrats2, but an approach to data that empowers the subject matter experts within public organizations to do their best work. 1.2 Do I need to be an Excel god before I begin? No. 1.3 What tools should I use? This guide is written to be technology-agnostic. The changing nature of technology and the ahem lag of state agencies to pick up tools means that the principles outlined in this book superseed specific technologoes. However, you should start somewhere. This guide will include examples for both Excel and R. Government runs on Excel, so all of the examples and exercises will be Excel compatible. If you are comfortable with Excel3 and want to challenge yourself, boost your resume, and become a data wizard4, I would highly recommend learning R. This guide will walk you through all the steps necessary to learn how to analyze data democratically using both tools, but focusing on the principles and practices that are vital regardless of technology. 1.4 Getting Started with Excel All examples 1.5 Getting Started with R I would HIGHLY recommend you take an afternoon to work through Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of “R for Excel Users”. You will thank me later. *but if campaign folks are listening, don’t forget about Wisconson↩ aka you use vlookup, index(match), pivot tables, or Get &amp; Transform on a somewhat regular basis↩ For example, I used R to create this entire website↩ "],
